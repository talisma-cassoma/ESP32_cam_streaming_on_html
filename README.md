## Tools and technologies:

Our drone is controlled by WIFI signal, we capture the images through a camera integrated into our circuit and we visualize the images thanks to the interface.

For this project we chose to use the ESP8266(Node MCU 1.0V) and ESP32 microcontroller, for purely financial reasons. Associated with an OV2640 camera (2MG pixels) able to transmit in WIFI and live a video stream, images. The ESP32 is also programmable using the Arduino IDE. The two ESP choosed are also programmable using the Arduino IDE.

The three-thruster arrangement only allows forward / reverse / yaw movement, while the fourth thruster also allows for lateral translation. The five-thruster variant allows all four horizontal thrusters to push simultaneously in any horizontal direction.
In addition, placing the propellant outside the longitudinal axis of the vehicle will allow better turning moment, while providing the vehicle with high longitudinal stability.
As our misson is very simple we chose the three thruster design, so here is the architecture we chose for our drone:

based on **santoshsn** water drone design on tinkercad


this is how the robot circuit look like <br/>

<p>
we still increasing features to the projets so this circuit shall be more complete with time 

we control our drone through a web browser (client side), The front-end of our web app communicates with the back-end by web socket protocol, for that we use the socket.io which is a JavaScript library for real-time web applications

this app use firebase as midleware for comunicate our robot to our server

we're using mask-RCNN for classifie marines species.
