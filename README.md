## Functional description of needs:
 
- [x] Integrates a camera and a wifi module on bot for remote control. 
- [x] Dectect and recognise marine speicie from images stream. 
- [x] Create a simple and pleasant interface to control the device underwater.
- [ ] Design an impermeable structure to protect the circuit on the water.

## Tools and technologies:

Our drone is controlled by WIFI signal, we capture the images through a camera integrated into our circuit and we visualize the images thanks to the interface.

For this project we chose to use the ESP32 microcontroller, for purely financial reasons. Associated with an OV2640 camera (2MG pixels) able to transmit in WIFI and live a video stream, images. The ESP32 is also programmable using the Arduino IDE. The ESP32 is also programmable using the Arduino IDE.

this is how the robot circuit look like <br/>
we still increasing features to the projets so this circuit shall be more complete with time 
we control our drone through a web browser (client side), The front-end of our web app communicates with the back-end by web socket protocol, for that we use the socket.io which is a JavaScript library for real-time web applications


this app use firebase as midleware for comunicate our robot to our server

we're using mask-RCNN for classifie marines species
